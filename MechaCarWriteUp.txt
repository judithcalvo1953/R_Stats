REPORT:
--the above model showed that car length, and ground clearance were the only variables that contributed significantly to the variance in MPG.
--this is seen by the coefficient of .63 (6.267e+00) for car length and .35 ( 3.546e+00) for ground clearance.  Both p-value <0.0001.
--the R-squared value is .71, meaning the model contributes to 71% of the variance in MPG. Another way of explaining it is that it is probability metric to
  determine the likelihood that future data points will fit this model.

--See also: Bruce, P and Bruce A (2017). "Practical Statistics for Data Scientists", O'Reilly Press, for an explanation of R-squared, also referred to as the Coefficient of Determination.
--The linear model predicts mpg of MechCar effectively as it meets the rule of thumb of 70% mentioned in the module.


To further explore this data, and create a more parsimonious model, I created the second model removed variables not statistically significant in the first model; there was a small decrement in R-squared

Part 2: SUSPENSION COIL ANALYSIS


#Next challenge question--suspension coil analysis
suspension <- read.csv('Suspension_Coil.csv', check.names = F,stringsAsFactors = F)

#both by Lot and all measures
summarize_coil <- suspension %>% group_by(Manufacturing_Lot) %>% summarize(Mean_PSI=mean(PSI), Median_PSI=median(PSI), SD_PSI = sd(PSI), Var_PSI =var(PSI),Num_items=n())
summarize_all_coil <- suspension %>% summarize(Mean_PSI=mean(PSI), Median_PSI=median(PSI), SD_PSI = sd(PSI), Var_PSI =var(PSI),Num_items=n())
---The variance of this data supports that the variance does not exceed 100 PSI.
---However, when examining by lot, Lot #3 does show a variance of 170.27, which is the only sub-group showing a difference.
---The data as a whole shows a variance of 62.29.  (findings in tabular format can be replicated using the Rscript).


Part 3:  SUSPENSION COIL COMPARISON TO POPULATION

sample_coil <- suspension %>% sample_n(50)

> View(suspension)
> t.test((sample_coil$PSI), mu=mean((suspension$PSI))) #compare sample versus pop means one-sample t-test

	One Sample t-test

data:  (sample_coil$PSI)
t = 0.39861, df = 49, p-value = 0.6919
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1498.78
95 percent confidence interval:
 1497.083 1501.317
sample estimates:

--The findings demonstrate that the sample PSI does not vary significantly from the popuplation, as p > 0.05 (p-value = 0.6919)


PART FOUR--MY OWN STUDY

CHALLENGE PART FOUR: MY OWN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
A/B (control/experimental design)-determinants of fuel economy/MechaCar vs. the “Others”
PART A OF THE STUDY/explore differences using t-tests:

The main question: does MechaCar outperform the competition in MPG?

Summary statistics of these factors will be performed first to show how the independent variables are distributed in the two samples: mean, median, SD, and variance.

Our original analysis using multiple regression showed that only car length and ground clearance were significant predictors of MPG.
We will conduct a randomized clinical trial of MechaCar’s performance data compared to a randomly selected control group of other car brands. 
Because the MechaCar data shows such a wide variation on the key factors we which to examine in terms of MPG, we will select a random sample from nationally published data for other car manufacturers. 
Variables to be included: car length, car weight, AWD, spoiler angle, and ground clearance, and MPG. 

Randomization should control for variation in the predictor variables.  
Then, we will conduct a two-sample, one-tailed test of means to determine if the MPG for MechaCar is significantly higher than competitor cars.



Part Two: Multiple Regression Analysis

Factors to consider are vehicle weight, vehicle length, spoiler angle, ground clearance and AWD present or not as they relate to MPG.  
 
Our goal is to answer the question, given other factors that we know, such as vehicle length, spoiler angle and ground clearance: 
is MechaCar’s fuel economy significantly better than the competitors' cars, and what are the other factors that predict MPG?

We will use multiple regression, with car brand as a dummy variable (1-MechaCar vs. 0-competitors).  Car brand will be one of the predictor variables.
Part two takes a more in-depth look at the two samples using multiple regression, with a dummy variable that designates: 1-MechaCar/experimental group vs. 0-other car brands/control group and a dummy variable of AWD present as 1 and not present as 0.  
Given the original study, we would only consider car length and ground clearance as predictors for the first model. 
Depending on the R-square and the significance of the beta coefficients, there may be a need to construct another model, using the other variables as predictors.

Based on preliminary multiple regression analysis of the MechaCar data, we found that only ground clearance and vehicle length were significant predictors of MPG; 
the other factors did not contribute significantly to R-squared, nor were the beta coefficients statistically significant.  
Removal of the non-significant factors reduced the R-square to .67 from 71., not an appreciable decline.

In this case, we are creating a model to predict differences in mpg based on whether the car is a MechaCar or not, vehicle length, and ground clearance.  
Should the car brand be the strongest determining factor in terms of the beta coefficient and examination of the R-squared shows that the other factors are not significant, we will have to
consider other unmeasured factors. We may be faced with going back to the laboratory to determine possibly unmeasured factors that are affecting MPG.
